# üéØ Patch Challenge: **Driftwood Tones** (Revised for Morphagene + Sealegs)

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Theme  
Create a **gentle, musical, and calming patch** that evokes the feeling of driftwood bobbing in water ‚Äî slow, deliberate motion with subtle shifts.  
Focus on soft tone, minimal modulation, and restrained patching.

---

## üß© Constraints (Updated)

- **Primary voice**: Use **Morphagene**
- **FX**: Use **Sealegs** only (not Bib)
- **Max patch cables**: **6 total**
  - Enough for audio routing **plus up to 2 modulation paths**
- No external modulation sources (≈åchd, etc.)
- Keep modulation **slow and smooth**
- No aggressive distortion or FM ‚Äî this is about clarity and peace

---

## üéß Suggested Patch Structure

1. **Morphagene**: Load a soft, ambient reel
   - One or two long slices with droning or tonal content
   - Loop the slice(s)
   - **Manual or modulated control** over:
     - Gene Size (for granularity)
     - Slide (for subtle movement)
     - Varispeed (slow drift)
   - Optional modulation via Chaos or Atte

2. **Sealegs**:
   - Route Morphagene ‚Üí Sealegs L input (mono)
   - Sealegs stereo output ‚Üí Stereo Mixer
   - Settings:
     - Moderate delay time
     - High mix (wet-focused)
     - Low feedback
     - No shimmer
   - Modulate **Mix** or **Color** with Chaos or Morphagene envelope if desired

3. **Mixer**:
   - Stereo output to final listening setup

## üîß Cable Allocation Example (6 cables)

| From        | To              | Purpose                         |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Morphagene | Sealegs (L in)   | Audio                           |
| Sealegs     | Stereo Mix (L/R) | FX output                       |
| Chaos CV    | Morphagene Slide | Slice motion                    |
| Chaos CV    | Sealegs Mix      | Gentle FX modulation            |
| (optional)  | Atte             | Attenuation of Chaos            |
| (optional)  | Manual control   | Use spare input as CV switch    |

## üéöÔ∏è Performance Tips

- Adjust **CV attenuators by hand** for expressive shifts
- Tune Sealegs for **long, soft tails** or **warped pitch effects**
- Let Chaos cycle slowly ‚Äî minimal change over time
- Treat Morphagene‚Äôs playback as **a breathing instrument**

## üìù Reflection Prompts

- Did this patch feel meditative, musical, or ambient?
- Which parameter was most satisfying to control by hand?
- How did the 6-cable limit shape your decisions?
- If you were allowed only one more modulation, what would it be?
