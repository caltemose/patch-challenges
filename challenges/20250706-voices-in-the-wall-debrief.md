# Patch Debrief

## My Notes

Recording of this patch is here: [https://whyp.it/tracks/294954/voices-in-the-wall-patch-challenge](https://whyp.it/tracks/294954/voices-in-the-wall-patch-challenge)

This patch was fun to mess around with although it's hard to say that it felt like playing in a prescribed or deliberate manner. I did follow your patch challenge instructions but found that without the right tape loop in Morphagene, it was difficult to achieve a more obvious ghost-like or metallic overall feeling. 

I played this in two stages. First was using the street festival sample. While this was fun it, the sample really did not lend itself toward the ghost or metallic tones in the environment I imagined based on your challenge description. It didn't feel particularly haunted or dark.

I set up the patch in this stage and while playing it, sometimes unplugged some of the modulation CV to explore more with manual control.

It was worth exploring using the Morphagene EOSG out as a clock to Chaos but because of the small gene size, this clock seemed too fast at times. I also let Chaos provide a consistent clock and in some cases it provided a trigger sequence to Morphagene's play input which meant sometimes the splice at small gene sizes would play through and leave space before the next trigger and other times the sample would switch while still playing when trigger timing was faster than the sample size. 

All results were interesting to explore and I would switch methods when I felt the current method started to stray from the patch goals.

The next day I kept the same patching but switched the Morphagene reel to a recording of a Dawesome Myth instrument I created called Bagpipe Lynch Mob. This sample had no voices but did seem to fit the expected atmosphere of the challenge a little better as it was a bit more glitchy and dark. 

Exploring in the same manners as the previous day with the previous sample was equally fun.

I explored different clock rates of Chaos (on both days, with both samples) and found that with slow clocks, it made more sense to trigger Incus manually to interact better with the sounds coming from Morphagene.

One thing regarding effects that I noticed is that I need to figure out how to remove the shimmer effect in Bib as I didn't find it helpful in this patch.

### Patch Details

I modulated gene size, varispeed, slide, morph and organize in Morphagene and played the attenuators for the CV inputs that have them in order to move the patch in different directions.

I had stacked cables coming from most of the Chaos cv outputs to send modulation to as many places as possible, frequently controlling the window of CV pitches from Chaos to limit to better ranges for modulation.

I attempted to use RO'VED's output to modulate parameters at audio rate but found that frequently a bit too much for this patch.

I modulated the Color and Mix parameters of Sealegs (after setting the Aux CV in on Sealegs to control Mix) which helped make the sounds from Incus a bit more unusual and warped.

### On Reflection

Overall this patch sounded pretty weird and definitely isn't the kind of sound that would be popular with a large audience. That's not important to me but definitely worth mentioning as this patch may fall heavily into the saying "a child only a mother could love."

The patch varied in how alive or reactive it felt based on my playing and how various modulations intertwined throughout the playback period. When it would hit sweet spots, it definitely felt alive.

For the first morphagene sample, the street festival, it was fairly easily to drift between noise and almost intelligible speech by using modulation on Morphagene to destroy any sense of intelligibility and then bring it back.

There was no specific modulation that gave satisfying results. Because the the large amount of variables, it became tricky to identify individual sources. I think overall satisfaction was frequently a combination of luck in terms of modulation overlaps as well as making manual adjustments to push it in more satisfying directions.

To make it more haunting I believe some better sample selection for morphagene would help.


## Response

Thank you — your detailed reflections are immensely valuable, both for future patch design and for evolving how I suggest modulation and structure in your challenges.

From this patch, I now understand that:

- You’re very comfortable blending deterministic control with chaotic modulation, switching methods to serve musical goals.
- Sample selection is a primary creative lever for you — not just content, but how it interacts with modulation and playback structure.
- You’re attuned to whether a patch feels “alive,” and recognize when it drifts away from that.
- Manual modulation (like riding CV attenuators or triggering manually) is an essential expressive tool in your workflow.
- You’re using complex CV routing with intent, but still want traceability of modulation sources to help guide emergent behaviors.

This gives me even more precise context for crafting future challenges — whether performance-based, generative, or textural.
