# 🎯 Patch Challenge: **Portal** (2-Scene Performance Study)

## 🌀 Theme
Two sonic states — **Still** and **Shimmer** — with smooth, performable transitions between them.  
Think clarity drifting into chaos, then resolving back again.  
This is a focused study in how to shape and *perform* transitions using structure, modulation, and effects.

---

## 🎧 Scene A: *Still*

- **Voice**: Surface or Chainsaw (or another stable oscillator)
- **Sequencing**: Tight, clocked pattern using **Hermod+** or **Pam’s Pro Workout (PPW)**
- **Filter**: Gentle filtering via Ikarie, ADVA, or Vult Freak
- **Modulation**: Subtle envelopes from **Zadar** or slow LFOs from **Maestro** or **PPW**
- **FX Path**: Route through **FX Aid XL** using one clean effect:
  - Plate Reverb
  - Chorus
  - Stereo Ensemble
- **Performance Controls**:
  - **F8R**: Reverb depth, filter cutoff, VCA level
  - **LS1**: Touch gestures for dynamic shifts
  - **Mutes**: Fade in/out modulation or sequencing

---

## 🎧 Scene B: *Shimmer*

- **Voice**: Same voice, now with instability
  - FM via Zephyr or CV modulation via **RND STEP**
- **Rhythm**: Disrupt with PPW probability, gate skipping in **Stochastic SIG**, or variable gate lengths
- **Filter**: High-pass, overdriven, or twin peak response via Ikarie or Freak
- **FX Path**: Route through a **second FX module**:
  - **Stardust** — for tape flutter, filtering, bitcrush
  - **Versio** (choose one firmware):
    - **Ruina** – distortion & destruction
    - **Melotus** – granular shimmer
    - **Desmodus** – modulated reverb
- **Modulation**:
  - Use **Maestro**, **Zadar**, or **PPW** to introduce fast or chaotic LFOs
  - Switch routing dynamically with **Vice Virga**

## 🔁 Scene Transitions

| Tool         | Function                                       |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **F8R**       | Fade between FX paths, filters, or VCA levels |
| **Vice Virga** | Switch CV or modulation targets               |
| **LS1**       | Touch control of FX depth or filter sweeps     |
| **Mutes**     | Drop voices or modulation to cue a scene shift |

---

## 🔧 Suggested Routing

- Voice → Filter → [Stereo Split]
- ↘→ FX Aid XL → Mixer (Scene A)
- ↘→ Stardust or Versio → Mixer (Scene B)


> Use VCAs, F8R, or manual switches to control sends.  
> Keep the same pitch/gate source, but process and modulate *differently*.

---

## 🧠 Practice Goals

- Go **A → B → A** several times — slow, smooth, deliberate
- Practice one transition using FX sends, one using modulation shifts
- Explore timing, pacing, and expressive control
- Try both **touch** (LS1) and **fader** (F8R) based performance

## ✅ Reflection Prompts

- What made the transition feel “performed” versus “switched”?
- Which tools gave you the most control over expressiveness?
- Did you favor modulation-based changes or FX layering more?
- What would you automate next time? What would you never automate?
