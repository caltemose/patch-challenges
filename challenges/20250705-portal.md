# 🎯 Patch Challenge: **Portal** (Updated for Two FX Paths)

## 🌀 Theme
Two sonic states — **Still** and **Shimmer** — with smooth, performable transitions between them.  
This is a focused study in how to shape and *perform* transitions using structure, modulation, and **dedicated FX paths**.

---

## 🎧 Scene A: *Still*

- **Voice**: Surface or Chainsaw (or another stable oscillator)
- **Sequencing**: Tight, clocked pattern using **Hermod+** or **Pam’s Pro Workout (PPW)**
- **Filter**: Gentle low-pass via Ikarie, ADVA, or Vult Freak
- **Modulation**: Subtle envelopes from **Zadar** or slow LFOs from **Maestro** or **PPW**
- **FX Path**: Route through **FX Aid XL** using a clean effect such as:
  - Plate Reverb
  - Chorus
  - Stereo Ensemble
- **Performance Controls**:
  - **F8R**: Modulate FX depth, filter cutoff, or voice level
  - **LS1**: Touch gestures for manual FX morphing
  - **Mutes**: Fade or remove modulation/gate signals for phrasing

---

## 🎧 Scene B: *Shimmer*

- **Voice**: Same oscillator, now destabilized
  - FM via Zephyr or pitch modulation via **RND STEP**
- **Rhythm**: Introduce chaos via PPW probability or stochastic sequencing (SIG)
- **Filter**: Drive harder, flip modes (e.g. twin peaks or HP on Ikarie or Freak)
- **FX Path**: Route through a **second FX processor**:
  - **Stardust** — for tape flutter, bitcrush, filtering
  - OR **Versio** with one of:
    - **Ruina Versio** – distortion, wavefolding
    - **Melotus Versio** – granular shimmer
    - **Desmodus Versio** – modulated reverb
- **Modulation**:
  - Stack LFOs/envelopes from **Maestro** or **Zadar**
  - Switch CV targets with **Vice Virga**

## 🔁 Scene Transitions

| Tool          | Use Case                                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **F8R**        | Fade between FX sends, filters, or VCAs       |
| **Vice Virga** | Switch modulation destinations                |
| **LS1**        | Morph FX mix or filter cutoff manually        |
| **Mutes**      | Drop voices or modulation at key transition   |

## 🔧 Suggested Routing

Voice → Filter → [Stereo Split]  
     ↘→ FX Aid XL → Mixer (Scene A)  
     ↘→ Stardust or Versio → Mixer (Scene B)

> Control routing with VCAs, F8R, or manual switch modules.  
> Keep the same pitch/gate source — but process and modulate *differently* in each scene.

---

## 🎯 Practice Goals

- Perform transitions **A → B → A** multiple times with precision
- Practice using *just one* controller type (e.g., LS1 or F8R)
- Explore different combinations of modulation vs FX vs filtering
- Evaluate what makes a transition feel expressive and intentional

## 📝 Reflection Prompts

- What method gave the most musical transition?
- Did modulation or FX routing have greater emotional impact?
- How would you scale this up for three scenes or live play?
